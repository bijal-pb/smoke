                <p class="subheading">About Us</p>
                <p>The Smoke Cellar started in San Antonio, Texas, as the brainchild of Braxton Rodetis, a cigar and pipe lover with a passion for technology. Having worked in a humidor, he often heard one cigar question more than any other, “I’m new to cigars, but don’t know where to start, what would you recommend?”, so he came up with an idea, what if there was an app that could help guide people in finding great cigar recommendations?Wouldn’t it be great if there was a virtual place for other tobacco lovers out there as well to write and read reviews and find other great cigars and tobaccos to try?</p>
                <p>The idea grew from there.</p>
